2. Install npm packages by typing 'npm install' in terminal inside the root of the downloaded repo.
3. Type 'npm start' to run a local instance of this with ReactJS.

### Future Goals / Plans

- To create a form that's either sent to broker's email, or sent to a backend portal that multiple mlo's can login to (more closely emulating original)
- Build more pages that use protected wordage (per industry)
